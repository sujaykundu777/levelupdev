### Some notes about struggling, not knowing the answers, and perseverance

There will be many times when you hit a ball when you don't know the answer to some problem and feel like you will never figure it out. I'd like to share just a few techniques for when this happens.

#### 1. Walk away

Take a break step away from the computer get some tea or coffee think about something else for a little while it can be valuable to just clear your head for a little while. You would be surprised how many times you will be able to quickly solve the problem and you return.

#### 2. Ask for Help

Don't be embarrassed or rush him to ask for help sometimes in the right direction is all you need to get back on track in my experience people loving people love helping out others and are more happy to spend a few minutes on your problem join some community in guitar or discord or slack where there is a community of people like you

##### 3. Move on to something else

If you really can't get it, there is no harm in moving on to another topic. It's nice to have a couple of projects that you can bounce between when you are feeling stuck on one or the other.
