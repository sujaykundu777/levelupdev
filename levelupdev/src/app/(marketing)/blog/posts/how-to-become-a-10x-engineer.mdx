### Reuse

Don't Re-invent the wheel

The Reuse 10X Behaviour implies a lesser need for new production, leading to waste minimization.

- **Be a reuser**: Reuse existing code, libraries, and frameworks to save time and effort.
- **Be a sharer**: Share your code and knowledge with others to promote collaboration and learning.
- **Be a contributor**: Contribute to open-source projects and share your expertise with the community.
- **Be a documenter**: Document your code and processes to make it easier for others to understand and use.
- **Be a standardizer**: Follow coding standards and best practices to ensure consistency and quality.

### Fosters Innovation

The Reuse approach encourages innovation, ultimately generating more value without starting from scratch.

### Sustainable Engineering

The Reuse approach is a key aspect of Sustainable Engineering which adopts a circular economy-driven mindset to reduce waste and increase efficiency.

### Being Multidimensional

Comprehensive Engineering Expertise

- Multidimensional engineers, bring a blend of expertise across various engineering, facets and SPEED capabilities, enabling them to contribute effectively to cross functional teams and enhance collaboration beyond traditional engineering boundaries

Versatile contribution to project development: in practical scenarios such as developing a mobile application, a multidimensional Engineer proves invaluable by combining software engineering and UI UX design skills. This was reality extends to project management, client interaction and business process understanding.
- This multidimensionality enables engineers to contribute to various aspects of a project, from development to design, and even project management.
- This versatility enhances collaboration and communication within cross-functional teams, as engineers can bridge gaps between different disciplines and facilitate a smoother workflow.
- By understanding the broader context of a project, multidimensional engineers can make more informed decisions and contribute to the overall success of the project.

Exceptional Client values, the multidimensional engineers, diverse skill sets, allow them to go beyond the technical domain, engage with clients, understand their needs and deliver exceptional value

### Reduce

The Reduce 10X Behaviour implies a lesser need for new production, leading to waste minimization.

- **Be a reducer**: Focus on reducing waste and improving efficiency in your work.
- **Be a minimalist**: Simplify your code and processes to make them more efficient and easier to understand.
- **Be a prioritizer**: Focus on the most important tasks and eliminate unnecessary work.

### Less is more:

The reduce approach focuses on minimising resource consumption efforts, infrastructure, and cost while maintaining high functionality and performance.

### Future focused:

being a key feature of sustainable engineering. The reduce approach focuses on improving the efficiency of solutions that stand the test of time.

### Going green

Reducing resources, minimise the environmental impact of digital products and services

### Being a mentor

**Accelerating growth**

Mentors can help accelerate the learning process by sharing their knowledge, experiences and recommendations on which technical skills to develop how to network effectively and how to position themselves for career advancement
